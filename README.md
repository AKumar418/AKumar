# REQUIREMENTS
## INTRODUCTION
The Electricity Bill generator project is a mini project, which is used to calculate the electricity bill by taking input as units used. The code is written and executed using codeblocks. This project uses multifile application

### RESEARCH

People who don’t have technical knowledge of calculating electricity bill can use this application to predict electricity bill of upcoming months, however, the defining features of an electricity bill calculator include:

power rating of all loads
total load calculation
unit consumed per day
units consumed per month
In addition, high-end electricity bill calculators generally include:

electricity bill calculation in urban areas
electricity bill calculation in rural areas
bill calculation based on units consumed

Defining System:

Design and testing operations of electricity bill calculator using unit testing algorithm.

SWOT analysis:

Strengths: Innovative, User-friendly.

Weakness: Cost of calculator increases as features added in the calculator increase.

Opportunities: We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation. So tech based market always attracts the youth.

Threats: Slower growth in an innovation always threat for the company in this dynamic world.
